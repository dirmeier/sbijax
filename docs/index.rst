    Simulation-based inference in JAX

----

``Sbijax`` is a Python library for neural simulation-based inference and
approximate Bayesian computation using `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_.
It implements recent methods, such as *Sequential Monte Carlo ABC*,
*Surjective Neural Likelihood Estimation*, *Neural Approximate Sufficient Statistics*
or *Consistency model posterior estimation*, as well as methods to compute model
diagnostics and for visualizing posterior distributions.

Example
-------

``Sbijax`` implements a slim object-oriented API with functional elements stemming from
JAX. All a user needs to define is a prior model, a simulator function and an inferential algorithm.
For example, you can define a neural likelihood estimation method and generate posterior samples like this:

.. code-block:: python

    from jax import numpy as jnp, random as jr
    from sbijax import NLE
    from sbijax.nn import make_maf
    from tensorflow_probability.substrates.jax import distributions as tfd

    def prior_fn():
        prior = tfd.JointDistributionNamed(dict(
            theta=tfd.Normal(jnp.zeros(2), jnp.ones(2))
        ), batch_ndims=0)
        return prior

    def simulator_fn(seed, theta):
        p = tfd.Normal(jnp.zeros_like(theta["theta"]), 0.1)
        y = theta["theta"] + p.sample(seed=seed)
        return y


    fns = prior_fn, simulator_fn
    model = NLE(fns, make_maf(2))

    y_observed = jnp.array([-1.0, 1.0])
    data, _ = model.simulate_data(jr.PRNGKey(1))
    params, _ = model.fit(jr.PRNGKey(2), data=data)
    posterior, _ = model.sample_posterior(jr.PRNGKey(3), params, y_observed)

Installation
------------

You can install ``sbijax`` from PyPI using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sbijax

To install the latest GitHub <RELEASE>, just call the following on the command line:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install git+https://github.com/dirmeier/sbijax@<RELEASE>

See also the installation instructions for `JAX <https://github.com/google/jax>`_, if you plan to use :code:`sbijax` on GPU/TPU.

Contributing
------------

Contributions in the form of pull requests are more than welcome. A good way to start is to check out issues labelled
`"good first issue" <https://github.com/dirmeier/sbijax/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22>`_.

In order to contribute:

1) Clone :code:`sbijax` and install :code:`hatch` via :code:`pip install hatch`,
2) create a new branch locally :code:`git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature` or :code:`git checkout -b issue/fixes-bug`,
3) implement your contribution and ideally a test case,
4) test it by calling ``make tests``, ``make lints`` and ``make format`` on the (Unix) command line,
5) submit a PR üôÇ
